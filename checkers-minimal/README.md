# Checker Module
This module is used in the "chain-minimal" project.



 ### Side notes from the tutorial:

- ðŸ’¡When you save strings, it makes it easier to understand what comes straight out of storage but at the expense of storage space. As an advanced consideration, you could store the same information in binary.
- ðŸ’¡Since Index is used to store and retrieve the stored game, it does not need to be saved to storage. This saves precious storage space.
